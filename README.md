As a Economics major here at UCLA I often find myslef fasinated with many of the extranous effects certain policies have on communities.
I found my research on the Eastern State Penitientary to be a good oppurtunity to explore some of interests. 
Conducting research for this project has not only allowed me to strengthen my python coding skills, but also allowed me to ultize many of the statistical and analytical skills I have learned in many of my other economics and digital humanities courses.
